		QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Why did more client output result when you added the loop
to read extra messages after each successful message receipt? Why
were some messages never printed? Why were some printed late and out
of order?</li>
<li class="a">
The loop caused more output because it essentialy allowed delayed packets to be listened for on the network and printed.
Some messages were never printed because the C150NastyDgmSocket class caused some of the client-sent packets to be dropped, which is one cause of the multiple retries that were attempted when the nastiness was increased. 
My best understanding for why some messages were printed out of order is because some messages were somehow delayed through the C150NastyDgmSocket class and then sometimes printed upon a read call on the client side if the packet managed to make it successfully, even if the read call was meant to read a more recent message from the server. 
</li>

<li class="q">What was confusing about this assignment or 
programming framework that we should
explain in more detail before proceeding to the next assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
I was quite confused if I was even doing the programming assignment correctly. I had bugs in my code and did not even know what exceptions I should or should not be seeing or how my code should react according to the instructions given. I also would like to know the reason why some of the errors I saw occured, such as how its possible that packages sent a while ago but never 
received back from the client can then just show up on another unrelated read call. 
</li>


<li class="q">How much UDP (datagram) style programming did you already know before doing this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
None. All of this was quite new and a litle strange to me, given how predictable programming that I am use to normally is.
